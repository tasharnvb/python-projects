# Python Programming

This is what I have done while trying to learn Python.

I have mainly been reading a Python book called [*__Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner__*](http://amzn.eu/94o84Zl) (Third Edition) written by Michael Dawson.

These directories refer to the chapters in the book and they contain my answers to the challenges set in each chapter.

| Chapter |                      Subject                      |
|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
|    1    |       Printing Strings and Writing Comments       |
|    2    | Types, Variables and Getting and Using User Input |
|    3    |     Branching (if statements) and While Loops     |
|    4    |     For Loops, String Manipulation and Tuples     |
|    5    |              Lists and Dictionaries               |
|    6    |                     Functions                     |
|    7    |               Files and Exceptions                |
|    8    |                      Objects                      |
|    9    |            Object Oriented Programming            |
|   10    |                  GUI Development                  |

### Notes

* Most of the code is provided with the book (although the source files are not included here) so a fair amount of this code was adapted to complete the challenges.

### To-do

* Rename these folders so that it is clear what was focused on in each chapter without the use of the table.
* Add readme files to each folder describing what each file is (Maybe just describing the challenge?)
* Refactor code (where appropriate) so that it follows the PEP-8 style guide
